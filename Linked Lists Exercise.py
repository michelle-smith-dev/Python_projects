# Extract an element from a linked list with the node
# Create a class for the node with head, value of None. This is the dummy node for the linked list.
# Create a class for the queue, to build the linked list. This will include a for loop to assign a value to the next of head in a list.
# I will need a variable pointing to the list created.
# In the queue class, I need to keep track of the current value assigned to the dummy node, and then next value and so on.
# To extract an element, I can use a while loop to loop through the linked list, using the dummy node, then go to the .next value and so on
# If "value" exists, print 'XYZ' by using elif statements with while loop. Use Else if value doesn't exist, break.

'''Rules of the game
Two players play the game against each other; letâ€™s assume Player 1 and Player 2.

Player 1 plays first by setting a multi-digit number.
Player 2 now tries his first attempt at guessing the number.
If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then Player 1 hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player 2 got correct.
The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.
Now, Player 2 gets to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.
If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned Mastermind.
If not, then Player 2 wins the game.'''
# Start the game by first
# Getting user input to guess a 4 digit number

# Keep track of how many guesses the player has guessed.

# Compare the random number with the user input

# If they are equal, break play, store user count of guesses to play against player 2.
# If they guess the number on first try, print they are a mastermind, game ends.

# If number is not guessed, reveal if user got any digits correct, that are in the correct spot. Compare using a
# for loop via indexed values of number guess vs random number

# Repeat code until player is able to guess digit, then break.

# Start game play for player two, will be same as above. Unless a player guessed the number on the first try,
# after second player has guessed the digit, compare the counters for each player to determine winner
